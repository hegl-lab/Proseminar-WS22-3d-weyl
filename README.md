The 2D part of the application was coded using Angular - the CLI to run it locally can be downloaded via npm from:
[Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)

### Running the application locally
Change into the main folder by running `cd 2D/rootSystems`.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server after installing the CLI.
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
